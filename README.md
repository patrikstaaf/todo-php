# Code Review

Code review written by [Neo Lejondahl](https://github.com/NeoIsRecursive).

1. `Controllers` - Strict types,
2. `CategoryTaskController:21` - Maybe validate format aswell,
3. `Models/User:61-66` - You have created hasmany on the user but never use them?,
4. `web.php` - Really like the structure and how it looks, easy to see were stuff is.
5. `resources/css/app.css` - maybe make some own classes and @apply tailwindcss classes to them, if you repeat lots of classes on more than one location example buttons or nav links, 
6. `accesability` - I could navigate and do everything on the site with only the keyboard, great! 
7. `overall` - I like it, the code is clean and ‘simple’ which is great. Really good job and it looks good aswell,
